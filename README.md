# AddressBookAngular
The aim of this self-project is to create a web-app "Address Book" to test the knowledge of basic AngularJS learned by going through basic online tutorials available easily.

## Getting Started:

1. To begin with angularJS, one must start with understanding the MVC structure of angular, which makes it easier to understand the further concepts and also why it is such a popular framework.
2. This project uses gulp - a streaming build system, for one task - SASS to CSS, to get a little overview, hands-on of the build system and to make ourselves familiar with modern web-development tools
3. To create an address book app and to learn angularJS, a total beginner path is as follows;
   <br/> (Basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript is required)
    1. Start with the basic free course from CodeSchool [Shaping up with Angular js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angularjs)
    this will clear a little basics and gives a fair idea about how angularJS works.
    <br/>Once your complete the tutorial, their wrap-up video shows a lot of interesting websites to study angularJS like 
    [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-building-an-angular-app-eggly-introduction), 
    [thinkster.io](https://thinkster.io/topics/angular) etc..
    2. The second free course is from CodeAcademy [Learn AngularJS1.X](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs)
    3. Both the above courses help us to understand the working of angularJS by giving different challenges, exercises and a  different approach to the same basics thereby giving a broader picture of the fundamentals.
    4. Lastly the course on Udemy on [AngularJS for beginner](https://www.udemy.com/angularjs-for-beginners-udemy/learn/v4/overview) will clear most of the doubts and you can create an app like AddressBook all by yourself.
4. Also to set up a build process [Gulp for beginners](https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/) by css-tricks is a very helpful article.
